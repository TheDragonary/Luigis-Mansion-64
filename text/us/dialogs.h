          Diary\n\
\n\
  August 14th, 2001\n\
\n\
Dear diary: Today, we \n\
played Hide'n'Seek, and \n\
I had to count again.\n\
I always hate counting\n\
because it's annoying.\n\
\n\
And while I searching\n\
my friends, I found \n\
this strange shiny \n\
star thing.\n\
\n\
\n\
I had no use for it \n\
so I tossed it into \n\
a large pond full of\n\
fishes. I bet no one \n\
will find it again...\n\
\n\
Anyway, I wonder if it\n\
has something useful\n\
for anybody?\n\

Collect 100 of them \n\
